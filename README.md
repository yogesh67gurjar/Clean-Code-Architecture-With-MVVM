# Clean-Code-Architecture-With-MVVM

A simple example of Clean code architecture with MVVM

Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing a clean and efficient implementation of Android app architecture. In this project, we have leveraged the power of Clean Code Architecture along with MVVM pattern, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for network communication, and Use Cases for business logic separation.

Features:

Clean Code Architecture: Our project adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
MVVM Pattern: We have adopted the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern to facilitate a clear separation of UI and business logic.
Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection is handled seamlessly with Dagger Hilt, promoting modularity and testability of our codebase.
Retrofit: Network requests are made efficiently using Retrofit, providing a robust mechanism for API communication.
Use Cases: Business logic is encapsulated within Use Cases, promoting reusability, testability, and maintainability of our application.
Key Components:

Presentation Layer: Activities and Fragments implementing the MVVM pattern, along with ViewModels.
Domain Layer: Use Cases encapsulating business logic, ensuring separation from presentation and data layers.
Data Layer: Repositories responsible for data operations, Retrofit service for API communication.
